# Flight Finder

## Introduction

Flight Finder is a Python application that allows users to search for the cheapest flight options between two locations. The user inputs the IATA codes for the origin and destination, selects departure and return dates, and specifies the number of passengers. The app then retrieves the cheapest available flights using the Amadeus API and displays the total price in Euros.

This project was created as part of the **CS50x** course by **Harvard University**. The video demonstration of this project can be found on YouTube, along with my certificate of completion.

## Features

- **Flight Search:** Enter the origin, destination, departure, and return dates to find the cheapest flight.

- **Date Validation:** Ensure the input dates are valid and that the return date is later than the departure date.
- **Passenger Input Validation:** Allow only positive integers for the number of passengers.
